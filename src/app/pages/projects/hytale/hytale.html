    <p class="mb-5">I have been following Hytale ever since it was announced back in 2018. Seeing how mods have always
      been a central idea to Hytale has been so inspirational. Now, all the way in 2026, I'm finally seeing firsthand
      just how mod friendly the game really is! There are so many systems, examples, and assets freely available for
      people to modify, learn from, and run with brand new ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, I've created a few mods. The first was a helmet antler mod. I didn't like how the helmets in the game
      covered my face, and I loved the look of the antlers on the deer! I was also inspired by Elden Ring, where my
      favorite helmet was a pair of antlers. So I opened Blockbench for the first time, dug through the files, and made
      my first mod! I released it on CurseForge, and it's gotten so much more love than I was expecting. I also made my
      dog Mira in the game, so you can now run around as her!

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built Hytale Mods.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">There are so many systems in place that all of my mods so far have been made using tools released by
      Hytale. The asset editor helped me create brand new helmets using the existing ones as reference. The new Mira
      model was based on an existing model that I edited to better match her.

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>The main thing I've learned so far from making these mods is that even when things feel overwhelming and full of
      unknowns, I can still take it one step at a time and make something cool. I really needed the reminder of how much
      I love creating and building new things. Hytale has been such a creative outlet for me, and I hope I can continue
      to make better and better things with these incredible tools!
