    <p class="mb-5">Froge was the first game jam I ever entered. I had made a few small games before and wanted to test
      my skills and see what I could do under pressure. The game jam theme was “frog,” and since I love platformers, I
      decided to make a game where you jump from lily pad to lily pad. I didn’t want to just use a regular frog because
      that felt a little too obvious, so I drew my dog wearing a frog hat instead. You play as her, hopping between lily
      pads and collecting dog treats. The more treats you grab, the longer you survive and the more points you earn. The
      jam only lasted three days over a weekend, so I had to work really fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After submitting, the game ended up ranking 28th in the “enjoyment” category out of 287 entries, which was a huge
      confidence boost for my first game jam.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built Froge.</p>
    <p>I built the game in Unity since that was the engine I knew best. I used GIMP to draw all of the pixel art for the
      game. The first day was spent building out all the core systems and getting the basic assets in place. The second
      day was focused on fixing bugs and balancing the game so it actually felt fun. On the final day, I playtested,
      refined what I could, and prepared the final build to submit.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>This project taught me how important quick prototyping is to make sure the game is heading in the right
      direction. I also learned not to cling to systems or ideas if they no longer make sense for the game. Games tend
      to shape themselves as you build them, and sometimes they show you what’s fun and what isn’t. Being willing to
      adapt ended up being one of the biggest lessons from this jam.
