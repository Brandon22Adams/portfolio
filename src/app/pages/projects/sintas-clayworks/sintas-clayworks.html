    <p>
      My spouse wanted to start her own polymer clay jewelry business and needed a website. Since I'm a professional web
      developer, I decided to build one from scratch and make it easy for her to add new products, remove old ones, and
      update the site whenever she wanted. She helped with the design, color schemes, and deciding what she wanted to
      show on each page. From there, I built everything from the frontend and backend to the Mongo database and
      deployment on DigitalOcean.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built Sinta's Polymer Clayworks.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">I built the site using Angular for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for the
      database, and hosted everything through DigitalOcean. I integrated Stripe to handle payments and receipts, and I
      added OAuth so my wife and I could log in and manage products directly from the site.</p>
    <p>
      I created a dynamic products page with filters based on whatever was in stock, along with filters for color,
      shape, and style. I also added sorting and search options to make browsing easier. I built a full cart system that
      connected to Stripe, handled payments, sent receipts, and notified us about what was ordered and where to ship
      everything.

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>This project taught me a lot about integration and working across the entire stack. Most of my professional
      career has been focused on frontend development, but this project pushed me to learn how backends connect to
      databases and how everything ties together on the hosting side. It helped me understand the full flow of data and
      what it actually takes to build a complete website from start to finish.
