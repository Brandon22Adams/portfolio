    <p class="mb-5">Glitch War was my early attempt at becoming a full-time game developer. I wanted to create a
      production-quality game that could be sold and help support myself financially. I spent some time prototyping and
      gathering inspiration before settling on the concept. Glitch War is a unit-building game where you buy units with
      different stats and send them down lanes to battle enemies who are sending their own units. The goal is to build
      the ideal team, grow your production, and destroy the enemy’s portal.

    <p>
      I also added extra layers of gameplay, including an overworld between levels, puzzle levels, boss battles, and
      hidden secrets throughout the world. To help fund development and release on Steam, I ran a Kickstarter to raise
      $500 for assets and compensation for my time. The campaign exceeded expectations, raising over $800.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built GlitchWar.</p>
    <p>I built the project in Unity, using a mix of purchased assets and some I created myself. I designed systems for
      units that allowed me to iterate quickly and balance their stats efficiently. I also created unique areas and
      playable characters to keep the gameplay varied. After finishing development, I released the game on Steam for $1.
      While the game was complete, I learned that marketing was a challenge. I didn’t spend enough time or resources
      promoting it, which limited its reach.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>This project taught me how challenging full production game development really is. I discovered that starting a
      project and finishing it are often the hardest parts, while the middle of development the actual creation is the
      sweet spot. I also gained experience with publishing, marketing, and the amount of work required to
      successfully release a game. Glitch War gave me a real appreciation for everything involved in creating a
      commercial game from start to finish.
