    <p class="mb-5">Me and my spouse got completely sucked into Stardew Valley. It was one of the first games we played
      together after getting married, and before long we were playing almost every night. We ended up with hundreds of
      hours in the game. I was really inspired by how much love and care went into Stardew itself, and even more
      inspired when I discovered the modding community. Everyone was so helpful, supportive, and genuinely excited to
      build on each other’s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to try modding for myself, so I joined the community Discord and spent time reading through their wikis
      to learn how everything worked. The mod I created is called ToolPouch. It lets players store all their tools in a
      single pouch to free up inventory space. With a configurable hotkey, they can open a radial menu and quickly swap
      between tools without cluttering their inventory. Since release, the mod has reached more than 6,700 unique
      downloads and has even inspired other modders to create expansions based on it.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built ToolPouch.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">I built the mod using C# and SMAPI. Stardew has tons of exposed functions and systems you can hook
      into, from player controls to UI elements, so there was a lot to learn. It was definitely challenging at first,
      but the community was incredibly helpful and I slowly figured things out.</p>
    <p>
      Once I finished version 1 and posted it to Nexus, it quickly started getting attention. People submitted bug
      reports, suggestions, and feature requests, so I kept improving it. I added more config options, fixed issues,
      supported compatibility with other popular mods, and even added translations when people reached out wanting to
      help. It has been really fun seeing other people build onto my mod and expand on the idea.

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>This project taught me how to read and understand other people’s code and source files, and how to work backwards
      to find exactly what I needed to hook into. I got better at digging through systems to figure out how to implement
      the functionality I wanted. I also learned how valuable a strong community and clear documentation can be,
      especially when you're stepping into an existing ecosystem.
