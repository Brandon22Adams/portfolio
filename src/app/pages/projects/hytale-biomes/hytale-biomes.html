    <p class="mb-5">Hytale has created a system to generate biomes using a series of nodes! Using simplex, and cell
      noise lots of math nodes some really incredible terrain shapes can be created. There is an extensive material
      system, prefabs, and environmental variables on top to make truly unique worlds. Making worlds has been a
      blast!

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>The biggest hurdle I have had to overcome and learn was how to manipulate noise into different shapes. All of
      their tooling and naming conventions were pretty straight forward but noise has been a tricky one to learn. Its
      been the perfect balance of technical problem solving and visual feedback. Its why I fell in love with Frontend
      Development and its why I have been enjoying building biomes.
