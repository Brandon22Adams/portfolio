    <p class="mb-5">Metroidvania games are some of my favorite games to play. I especially love Hollow Knight and Ori
      and the Blind
      Forest. When I saw there was going to be a Metroidvania game jam, I figured it would be a great chance to finally
      try making one myself. Since it was around Halloween, I decided to give it a spooky vibe with a ghost as the main
      character. I also wanted it to be kid-friendly so my nieces and nephews could play it. Plus, it was way easier to
      animate a floating ghost than a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jam lasted 30 days, so I spent that month balancing work, life, and building a full game from concept to
      release. The game ended up placing 15th out of 87 entries in the Metroidvania category. After reading all the
      encouraging comments, I decided to keep going. I spent a few more months adding new assets, improving the
      lighting, and making the world feel more alive. I eventually released the full version on itch.io for free because
      I wanted as many people as possible to play it.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">How I built Ghostie.</p>
    <p>At this point I was feeling pretty comfortable with Unity and C#, so that became the core of the project. One of
      my big goals with this game was to push myself artistically. I spent a lot of time practicing and improving my
      drawing skills and ended up creating every asset and animation myself. It was honestly one of the most fun parts
      of the project.</p>

    <p class="text-lg border-b-[1px] mb-1 border-purple-300 inline-block">What I learned.</p>
    <p>This project showed me how important it is to have a real plan. With a deadline, I had to figure out when
      systems, levels, and characters needed to be done so I had enough time to test everything and get it ready for
      release. I also learned more about lighting, animation, and creating enemy AI. Overall, it helped me grow in both
      game development and art, and gave me a better understanding of how to manage a full project from start to finish.
