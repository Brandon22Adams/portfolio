    <p>
      Breakout is a Breakout inspired game also known as Arkanoid. Breakout has three iterations over the years. The
      original Breakout was the second game I ever built, the first being a text-based adventure. I built it because it
      was the only type of game my dad would play, so I wanted to make something he could enjoy. Over time, as I
      developed prototypes and other games in my free time, I created three versions of Breakout. Only two are available
      to play now, but each version built on what I had learned from the previous one. The first version had just a few
      levels with a ball and paddle. The second added a level select and special abilities, and the final iteration
      introduced enemy levels where you had to compete against an opposing paddle.</p>

    <p>I built the game in Unity because it gave me the freedom to create any game I could imagine. I followed tutorials
      to learn how to build the original game and how to design systems that could carry over into future projects. Each
      iteration let me practice and refine both my technical skills and my understanding of game design.</p>

    <p>This project showed me how important it is to have a real plan. With a deadline, I had to figure out when
      systems, levels, and characters needed to be done so I had enough time to test everything and get it ready for
      release. I also learned more about lighting, animation, and creating enemy AI. Overall, it helped me grow in both
      game development and art, and gave me a better understanding of how to manage a full project from start to finish.
